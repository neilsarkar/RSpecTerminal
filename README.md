# RSpec Terminal

This is a Sublime Text 3 and Sublime Text 2 plugin for OS/X.

Rather than attempting to recreate the quirks of your rspec environment (rvm, color highlighting, binding.pry etc) this is a simple wrapper that passes your current file and optionally line number to rspec on the terminal.

## Usage:

    Cmd+R          = Run current file
    Cmd+Shift+R    = Run current line
    Cmd+Alt+Ctrl+R = Run last run test (from any file!)

## Patches Welcome

Feel free to open pull requests or issues on this repository.
